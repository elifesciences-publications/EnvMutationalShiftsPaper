# Env mutational shifts analysis

Analysis and paper "Mapping mutational effects along the evolutionary landscape of HIV envelope."
A pre-print of the paper is on _bioRxiv_ at [DOI 10.1101/235630](https://doi.org/10.1101/235630).

This repository is for the project by Hugh Haddox, Adam Dingens, and [Jesse Bloom](https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html) analyzing the effects of mutations to HIV Env in different strain backgrounds.
It involved deep mutational scanning of the BG505 and BF520 strains.

The repository is organized into the following subdirectories:

* [./paper/](./paper/) contains the manuscript describing the project.

* [./analysis_code/](./analysis_code/) contains the analysis of the actual data.
